9/2/20 Note: 

-MainWindow_addASD_condensed.py has the current progress with condensing the files  
-MainWindow_addASD_init_condensed.py runs MainWindow_addASD_condensed.py 

- all other files with 'condensed' in their name are also condensed from the prior files 
- also the formating of the ASD xml files are slightly different, so the code to read and 
  write them is shorter 

- Still working on maybe changing the TDC xml files so that their reading/writing process can be shorter

8/7/20 Note: 

-MainWindow_addASD.py has the current progress with adding ASD functions 
-MainWindow_addASD_init.py runs MainWindow_addASD.py 

-The files 'ASDX_popup.py' (X = 0,1,2) are the individual ASD popups

-The file 'create_ASD_defualt.py' creates an xml ASD file (Just one 
 xml file for all three ASDs)

-ASD_defualt.xml has the default ASD values stored for all three ASDs

(what to do about rising_is_leading individual channels and edge type things?)


7/28/20 Note: 

MainWindow_TDC_update_filedialog.py has the current progress with the filedialog 
MainWindow_TDC_update_filedialog_init.py runs MainWindow_TDC_update_filedialog.py

The menu bar here has all the load and the save operations 
- I'm still working on getting the file to save in a specific file rather 
  than in the current file!
